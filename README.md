# FarmTrack Technical Writing Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my technical writing skills through documentation for a fictional agricultural management app called **FarmTrack**.

FarmTrack helps farmers and ranchers track everything from crop and field activity to livestock events and equipment maintenance. It combines field logs, calving schedules, a farm calendar, weather alerts, and data from the Farmers’ Almanac—all in one place.

## 📂 What's Included

- **Getting Started Guide** – Setting up the app and user dashboard
- **Livestock Management** – Tracking bulls, pregnancy checks, calving, vaccines, and more
- **Field & Crop Management** – Mapping, planting, spraying, fertilizing, and harvesting
- **Equipment Tracker** – Service logs and usage tracking
- **Weather + Almanac Tools** – Forecasts, planting tips, storm alerts
- **Calendar + Reminders** – Centralized view of farm tasks

Each section is written in Markdown and organized into folders to simulate real-world documentation structure.
